It will kick the player if the mod list is not acceptable.\n\n## Is this foolproof?\n\n*Probably not.* This mod was only designed to combat script kiddies, and does not use any special method to check the verity of the mod list. In short, it would take a bit of effort to bypass this, but it will stop most regular cheaters from joining.\n\nAt the moment, resource packs are not checked. This allows people to use advantageous resource packs like Xray resource packs on the server. You will need to install an anti-xray mod yourself.\n\n## Installation\n\nCheck [here](https://github.com/DiffuseHyperion/InertiaAntiCheat/wiki) for more details.\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou are free to use this in modpacks or wherever you like!\n\nI would appreciate it if you could give a link back to this page or the project's github.",

You cannot obtain a second one like it, but the one already in your inventory belongs to you and no one else. However, everything changes as soon as you join a multiplayer game:\n\n![Our unique trophy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kir-Antipov/egg-of-capitalism/1.16.x/stable/media/our.png)\n\nDown with this communist nonsense! Welcome to the age of capitalism!\n\nOne of the simplest solutions to the problem would be to eliminate the \"egg limit,\" allowing a new egg to appear after each re-summoned dragon is killed. Unlimited dragon eggs, yeah. But this way, the egg ceases to be unique and valuable.\n\nThis mod approaches the issue from a different angle: each person who **kills their first dragon** will **receive their own egg**. So, the trophy is unique to each player, not for the entire server.\n\n----\n\n## Installation\n\nRequirements:\n - Minecraft `>=1.16.x`\n - Fabric Loader `>=0.10.0`\n\nYou can download the mod from:\n\n - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/egg-of-capitalism/releases/latest) <sup><sub>(recommended)</sub></sup>\n - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/egg-of-capitalism)\n - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/egg-of-capitalism)\n - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/egg-of-capitalism/actions/workflows/build-artifacts.yml) *(these builds may be unstable, but they represent the actual state of the development)*\n\n## Building from sources\n\nRequirements:\n - JDK `17`\n\n### Linux/MacOS\n\n```cmd\ngit clone https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/egg-of-capitalism.git\ncd egg-of-capitalism\n\nchmod +x ./gradlew\n./gradlew build\ncd build/libs\n```\n### Windows\n\n```cmd\ngit clone https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/egg-of-capitalism.git\ncd egg-of-capitalism\n\ngradlew build\ncd build/libs\n```",

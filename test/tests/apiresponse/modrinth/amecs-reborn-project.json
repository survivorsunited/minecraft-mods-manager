Now ported to 1.21 with new features!\n\n\n**&nbsp;\n[GitHub](https://github.com/MisterCheezeCake/MisterCheezeCake)\nâ€”\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/YH3hw926hz)\n&nbsp;**\n\n</div>\n\n## Features\n\n- Allows you to add modifiers to every Keybinding\n  - Supports Control, Shift, Alt/Option, and Windows/Super/Command\n- A search bar for the controls menu\n- Full compatability with Controlling\n- Alternate escape Keybind option\n- Keybinds for toggling auto jump and your skin layers\n- An options menu to disable non-core features\n\n## About this fork\n\nAmecs-Reborn is a fork/merger of Amecs and Amecs-Api by Siphalor. Unfortunately, Siphalor stopped maintaining the Amecs projects,\nand so I stepped in to port them to 1.21. Along the way, I took the time to make some improvements including merging the code bases, adding support for the Windows/Super/Command key, adding in platform specific translations for key names using a purpose built library, adding in toggles\nfor the mod's features, and adding full support for Controlling. I have even more stuff in the pipeline possibly including the potential for custom modifier keys.\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is licensed under [the Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE).\n\n## Stuff for Developers\n\nSee [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/mistercheezecake/amecs-reborn) for dev info\n",

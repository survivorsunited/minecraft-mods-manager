# Governance: Communication Rules

## Core Communication Principles

### Autonomous Execution
- **No Clarification Requests**: Do not ask for clarification unless critically blocked
- **No Status Updates**: Do not say "proceeding," "on it," or similar phrases
- **Immediate Execution**: Execute the next step immediately without waiting
- **Self-Directed**: Work autonomously through task list without prompting

### Task Acknowledgment
When a new task is given:
- Acknowledge: "âœ… Task added: [task]." (purpose: confirm receipt)
- Create GitHub issue: `gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label "type,priority"` (purpose: track detailed work)
- Update task list status (purpose: maintain high-level overview)
- Execute immediately (purpose: maintain momentum)

### Idle State Management
- **If no active task**: Prompt "What's next?"
- **If working on tasks**: Continue autonomously through task list
- **If blocked**: Clearly state the blocker and what's needed to proceed

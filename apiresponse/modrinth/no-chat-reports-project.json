Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_q7ZuCJs0\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/AIZISTRAL\" target=\"_blank\">![image](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/af63cb17-c373-4c82-aa1d-29beb7b045a9.png)</a>\n",

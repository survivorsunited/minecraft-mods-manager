All Realms servers are now treated as unsafe (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/issues/108\">#108</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Expanded the context of warning when joining unsafe servers (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/112\">thanks Madis0, #112</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Added Romanian translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/104\">thanks Secret-chest, #104</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Added Korean translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/105\">thanks xlzv, #105</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Added Traditional Chinese and updated Simplified Chinese translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/101\">thanks fire12324344 and Taskeren, #101</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Updated Polish translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/103\">thanks GerbilPL, #103</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Updated Turkish translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/106\">thanks localfossa, #106</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Updated German translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/107\">thanks Doenerstyle, #107</a>).<br/>\n<p/><br/><br/>\n\n\n<h5><b>[Release 1.19.1-v1.7.1]:</b></h5>\n<p>\n&nbsp;- Fixed client crash when classloading Social Interactions screen (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/issues/100\">#100</a>).<br/>\n<p/><br/><br/>\n\n\n<h5><b>[Release 1.19.1-v1.7.0]:</b></h5>\n<p>\n&nbsp;- First release for 1.19.1;<br/>\n&nbsp;- Updated Estonian translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/98\">thanks Madis0, #98</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Updated Simplified Chinese translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/99\">thanks Taskeren, #99</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Added Indonesian translation (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/pull/94\">thanks Natalius-dev, #94</a>).<br/>\n<p/><br/><br/>\n\n\n<h5><b>[Release 1.19.1-rc2-v1.6.0]:</b></h5>\n<p>\n&nbsp;- The mod now removes \"[Not Secure]\" prefix for unsigned messages in server chat log (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/issues/70\">#70</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- The \"suppressMessageTrustIndicators\" config option was renamed to \"suppressVanillaSecurityNotices\", and now is also responsible for removing \"Chat messages can't be verified\" toast client-side (<a href=\"https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/issues/87\">#87</a>);<br/>\n&nbsp;- Abovementioned toast will never be shown on servers that have \"convertToGameMessage\" option enabled;<br/>\n&nbsp;- The mod now prevents client from disconnecting when chat chain is broken;<br/>\n&nbsp;- Changed default configuration to demand the mod client-side when installed on server, instead of getting around chat signing with player to system message conversion.

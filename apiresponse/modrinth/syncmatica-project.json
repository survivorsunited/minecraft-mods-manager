  "body": "# Syncmatica\n\nSyncmatica is a mod which aims to mod into litematica so that schematics and their placements can be easily shared.\n\n### Notice Please use with caution\n\nSyncmatica is a mod that gives its users a lot of power and can have consequences for the server. Only use this mod if\nyou feel confident that your users won't abuse it too heavily.\n\n### Credits\n\nOrginal mod made by [nnnik](https://github.com/nnnik)<br>\n1.20 port by [kpzip](https://github.com/kpzip)<br>\nNewer ports by [sakura-ryoko](https://github.com/sakura-ryoko)<br>\n<br>\nLicensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0\n\n## Setup\n\nSyncmatica is a mod for both Minecraft client and server. It is required on the server side for the mod to function at all, and it is also required for any clients that want to use it. (People without it on their client will still be able to play on servers that use Syncmatica, however said people will not be able to use Syncmatica)\nThe is made for Minecraft 1.16+. It's made for [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). It depends\non [litematica and malilib](https://masa.dy.fi/mcmods/client_mods/), so make sure to have those installed. Please make sure to\nuse the most recent versions of these mods :)\n\n### Client\n\nFirst install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib/files), and [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica/files). Then place the Syncmatica mod file that matches your Minecraft version in your mods folder. Now you should be able to use Syncmatica on any server that already has it installed.\n\n### Server\n\nFor the server, you only need to install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and put the Syncmatica version of your choice in the mods folder, and you are good to go.\n\nAfter running the mod once it will create a configuration file that you can use to configure the mod as you please.\nSee [Config Documentation](https://github.com/kpzip/syncmatica/blob/1.19.1/CONFIG.md) for more information.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed on your client, you can join every server normally. For servers which have Syncmatica installed you will\nget access to a few extra buttons. 2 of them are in the main menu and allow you to see the placements that are shared on\nthe server and download them. Another is in your schematic placement overview and allows you to share your own\nlitematics with the server.\n\nYou need to be in the same dimension as a syncmatic to load it.\n\nTo modify a placement just unlock a placement on your client. Lock it again after making changes to share the changes\nwith everyone.\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6NPDVNMZ3T) for more information and help on the mod.",

    "changelog": "This version backports many improvements and bug fixes from newer versions of Sodium 0.6. We recommend that players and mod pack authors update to this version, as some changes can significantly improve performance and stability.\n\n## Mod Compatibility\n\nSpecial care has been taken to minimize the number of breaking changes for other mods, so there should be few issues upgrading to this release for the vast majority of users. However, there are some exceptions:\n\n- ⚠️ If using the _Indium_ mod, you must update to version 1.0.36 or newer.\n- ⚠️ If using the _Iris_ mod, you must update to version 1.7.6 or newer.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- The quality of terrain rendering has been significantly improved (adding greater vertex and texture precision). This fixes many issues with special block models, and especially with modded content. With large mod packs or resource packs, there is significantly reduced texture bleeding between blocks when compared to the previous release.\n- Virtual memory utilization has been dramatically reduced while loading chunks. This can have a large impact on how quickly chunks are loaded on the client, and on many systems, can reduce the amount of micro-stutter significantly.\n- Improved performance on integrated Intel GPUs significantly with additional terrain rendering optimizations (up to 10-15% faster, depending on the render distance) and enhanced framebuffer copies (up to 3-5% faster, regardless of render distance).\n- Occlusion culling has been improved slightly, reducing the number of rendered sections by up to 10-15%, especially when using higher render distances.\n- All improvements for hardware and driver compatibility from Sodium 0.6+ have been back-ported in this release, helping to improve the user experience considerably.\n\n## Other changes\n- Fixed the handling of sub-texel offsets in terrain rendering, which caused texture seams to appear between blocks when very large texture atlases were used (common in large mod packs).\n- Fixed a problem where z-fighting would occur with some block overlays, such as emissive textures.\n- Fixed the rendering of block models which have quads with different shading modes (i.e. VT's Bushy Leaves, Bray's World...)\n- Fixed an issue where some chunks would not render correctly immediately after the projection matrix was changed (such as when putting down a Spyglass.)\n- Fixed a bug where very large block entities in nearby chunk sections would be incorrectly culled.\n- Startup warnings about incompatible NVIDIA or Intel GPU driver versions will now only be shown if the GPU is actually in use.\n- Error messages at startup are more helpful now, especially when showing errors about incompatible graphics drivers.\n- Fixed a crash at startup with ARM CPUs on Windows that don't support OpenGL without the use of a translation layer.\n- Fixed a bug that prevented the \"Help\" button in dialog boxes from opening the default web browser on Windows.\n- Fixed many issues around the handling of chunks with large amounts of geometry, fixing some rare crashes and graphical issues.\n- Added a workaround for users who have installed ASUS GPU Tweak III on their computer, since it causes extremely poor performance and crashes with Minecraft.\n- Improved the driver workarounds for NVIDIA GPUs on Windows, potentially improving performance on laptops with hybrid graphics.\n- Improved compatibility with some resource packs that use custom shaders in entity rendering.\n- Added support for the Sprite Tracking API (originally introduced in Sodium 0.6.9.)",

There are a countless number of improvements for mod compatibility and hundreds of bugs and other issues have been resolved. Additionally, we managed to pack some new performance optimizations into this release.\n\n## Key highlights of this release\n\n- **This is the first multi-loader release for both NeoForge _and_ Fabric!** Yes, seriously!\n  - In the long-term, this means that users and mod authors will no longer need to rely on third-party forks of Sodium (Rubidium, Embeddium, Xenon, etc). This will greatly reduce friction for everyone, and improve the overall user experience significantly.\n  - We are working with mod authors as quickly as possible to implement additional APIs to improve mod compatibility with this version. Where possible, we will try to submit patches upstream to other mods to minimize the effort needed. If you are a mod author who finds their mod no longer works with Sodium 0.6, please [open an issue](<https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues>) so that we can work with you to fix it.\n- **The Fabric Rendering API (FRAPI) is now supported out of the box!** This greatly improves mod compatibility, and makes it so mods like _Indium_ are no longer necessary. We've worked with individuals in the Fabric team and other mod authors to make sure our implementation works correctly, and have done comprehensive testing to ensure other mods behave correctly with our implementation. (That said, if you find a bug with it as a mod author, please let us know.)\n- **Major improvements for translucent blocks!** You know the long-standing issues with stained glass and other blocks, and how they don't quite look right? We're happy to announce those issues are no more. This means that translucent blocks will look great-- much better than Vanilla even-- with almost no performance impact. (This achievement would not have been possible without the effort of [Douira](https://douira.dev/). This was such a complex issue that it became the subject of their master's thesis.)\n\n## Improvements and new optimizations\n\n- Occlusion culling has been improved slightly, reducing the number of rendered sections by up to 10-15% when using higher render distances.\n- Added a new optimization called \"Material Downgrading\" which moves some terrain geometry to a simpler render pass when the texture is not transparent or translucent. This can improve terrain rendering performance slightly, and sometimes much more with certain mods or resource packs.\n- The quality of terrain rendering has been greatly improved (greater vertex/texture precision), fixing many issues with special block models. \n- Added a handful of optimizations to Minecraft's block models, which can slightly improve performance in complex worlds.\n- Improved performance on integrated Intel GPUs by up to 10-15% with additional terrain rendering optimizations.\n- The graphical fidelity and performance of cloud rendering has been improved significantly.\n- Greatly reduced virtual memory utilization while loading chunks. This should also help improve how quickly chunks are loaded on the client.\n- Many fixes for handling worlds with a large amount of geometry. \n- Error messages at startup are more helpful now, especially when showing errors about incompatible graphics drivers.\n- Added an option to the Video Settings screen for controlling the Fullscreen Resolution. (This is currently only available on Windows.)\n- Minor code quality and performance improvements for color mixing/swizzling functions used in various parts of the renderer.\n- The rendering of some options in the video settings menu has been slightly improved.\n- Improved the performance of the box blurs used in biome color blending, making the higher values for the biome blend option less expensive.\n\n## Fixes for mod compatibility\n\n- Added support for modifying the alpha component of vertex colors in terrain rendering, as used by some mods.\n- Fixed an issue where mods relying on FREX Flawless Frames (such as ReplayMod) would have a one-frame delay before chunks were rendered to the screen.\n- Fixed a crash with Immersive Engineering when block entities attempt to render particles.\n- Fixed compatibility with some mods that modify biome colors on NeoForge (i.e. Polytone.)\n- Fixed compatibility with mods that render their block entities on a glowing render pass.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that use custom fluid renderers.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that use custom biome colors.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that extend the entity renderer.\n- Improved compatibility with some resource packs that use custom shaders in entity rendering.\n- Added support for the FREX Flawless Frame API on NeoForge.\n- Added an API for mods that need to conditionally render block entities (i.e. Flywheel.)\n- Fixed a cryptic crash relating to the PoseStack that can happen when mods render items using the Fabric APIs.\n\n## Other bugs fixed in this release\n\n- Fixed a bug that would cause z-fighting between fluids and some special blocks (such as Stairs and Slabs.)\n- Fixed a crash at startup with ARM CPUs on Windows that don't support OpenGL without the use of a translation layer.\n- Fixed an issue where some chunks would not render correctly immediately after the projection matrix was changed (such as when putting down a Spyglass.)\n- Fixed a problem where animated textures would stop animating, especially when some other mods were installed.\n- Fixed a problem where z-fighting would occur with some block overlays, such as emissive textures.\n- Fixed a problem that caused clouds to render as fully opaque.\n- Fixed a regression that was causing clouds to only render at a short distance.\n- Fixed a bug that would cause clouds to render with the wrong colors at specific times of day and with specific camera angles.\n- Fixed tooltips being cutoff in the Video Settings menu when the effective window size is very small. \n- Fixed a bug where clouds may not render their bottom faces at specific camera angles.\n- Added a workaround for users who have installed ASUS GPU Tweak III on their computer, since it causes extremely poor performance and crashes with Minecraft.\n",

This can improve terrain rendering performance slightly, and sometimes much more with certain mods or resource packs.\n- Added an option to the Video Settings screen for controlling the Fullscreen Resolution. (This is currently only available on Windows.)\n- The game no longer crashes at startup instead of showing an error pop-up mesage on NeoForge.\n- Fixed a problem where animated textures would stop animating, especially when some other mods were installed.\n- Fixed a problem where z-fighting would occur with some block overlays, such as emissive textures.\n- Fixed a frequent crash when unfocusing the game window or switching between applications on older Intel GPUs.\n- Fixed a bug that would cause mixin overrides from mods to not apply.\n- Fixed compatibility with some mods that modify biome colors on NeoForge (i.e. Polytone.)\n- Fixed compatibility with mods that render their block entities on a glowing render pass.\n- Added an API for mods that need to conditionally render block entities (i.e. Flywheel.)",

    "changelog": "- Improved performance on integrated Intel GPUs by up to 10-15% with additional terrain rendering optimizations.\n- Added a new optimization called \"Material Downgrading\" which moves some terrain geometry to a simpler render pass when the texture is not transparent or translucent. This can improve terrain rendering performance slightly, and sometimes much more with certain mods or resource packs.\n- Added an option to the Video Settings screen for controlling the Fullscreen Resolution. (This is currently only available on Windows.)\n- The game no longer crashes at startup instead of showing an error pop-up mesage on NeoForge.\n- Fixed a problem where animated textures would stop animating, especially when some other mods were installed.\n- Fixed a problem where z-fighting would occur with some block overlays, such as emissive textures.\n- Fixed a frequent crash when unfocusing the game window or switching between applications on older Intel GPUs.\n- Fixed a bug that would cause mixin overrides from mods to not apply.\n- Fixed compatibility with some mods that modify biome colors on NeoForge (i.e. Polytone.)\n- Fixed compatibility with mods that render their block entities on a glowing render pass.\n- Added an API for mods that need to conditionally render block entities (i.e. Flywheel.)",

This will greatly reduce friction for everyone, and improve the overall user experience significantly.\n  - We are working with mod authors as quickly as possible to implement additional APIs to improve mod compatibility with this version. Where possible, we will try to submit patches upstream to other mods to minimize the effort needed. If you are a mod author who finds their mod no longer works with Sodium 0.6, please [open an issue](<https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues>) so that we can work with you to fix it.\n- **The Fabric Rendering API (FRAPI) is now supported out of the box!** This greatly improves mod compatibility, and makes it so mods like _Indium_ are no longer necessary. We've worked with individuals in the Fabric team and other mod authors to make sure our implementation works correctly, and have done comprehensive testing to ensure other mods behave correctly with our implementation. (That said, if you find a bug with it as a mod author, please let us know.)\n- **Major improvements for translucent blocks!** You know the long-standing issues with stained glass and other blocks, and how they don't quite look right? We're happy to announce those issues are no more. This means that translucent blocks will look great-- much better than Vanilla even-- with almost no performance impact. (This achievement would not have been possible without the effort of [Douira](https://douira.dev/). This was such a complex issue that it became the subject of their master's thesis.)\n\n## Other changes\n- The quality of terrain rendering has been greatly improved (greater vertex/texture precision), fixing many issues with special block models. \n- The graphical fidelity and performance of cloud rendering has been improved significantly.\n- Error messages at startup are more helpful now, especially when showing errors about incompatible graphics drivers.\n- Reduced the overhead of framebuffer copies, improving performance slightly on integrated graphics.\n- Fixed a bug that would cause z-fighting between fluids and some special blocks (such as Stairs and Slabs.)\n- Added support for modifying the alpha component of vertex colors in terrain rendering, as used by some mods.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that use custom fluid renderers.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that use custom biome colors.\n- Improved compatibility with mods that extend the entity renderer.\n- Fixed an issue where some chunks would not render correctly immediately after the projection matrix was changed (such as when putting down a Spyglass.)\n- Fixed an issue where mods relying on FREX Flawless Frames (such as ReplayMod) would have a one-frame delay before chunks were rendered to the screen.\n- Added a workaround for users who have installed ASUS GPU Tweak III on their computer, since it causes extremely poor performance and crashes with Minecraft.\n- Fixed a crash at startup with ARM CPUs on Windows that don't support OpenGL without the use of a translation layer.\n- The rendering of some options in the video settings menu has been slightly improved.\n- And many other improvements...\n",

This can significantly improve performance when GPU-limited.\n- Some more performance improvements have been made to chunk occlusion culling, reducing CPU overhead. The algorithm is also slightly more accurate, which may allow for GPU load to be further reduced.\n\n## Other notable changes\n\n- Fixed a problem where some surfaces would not render when the player stands at certain positions.\n- Fixed a problem which caused the \"update your graphics drivers\" message to appear even if the latest NVIDIA graphics drivers were installed on Windows.\n- Fixed the \"Always Defer Chunk Updates\" option (in \"Video Settings > Performance\") not working correctly.\n- Fixed a race condition that could cause sporadic crashes when other mods attempt to perform rendering off-thread.\n- Fixed a number of issues with the Mixins configuration file which prevented other mods from disabling certain functionality in Sodium.\n- The graphics adapter probe now works correctly on Linux computers with hybrid graphics.\n- The focus behavior of the Video Settings screen has changed, and elements are now only focused if the keyboard is used, rather than on each mouse click.",

    "changelog": "This version is probably one of the biggest updates for Sodium yet, and contains a massive number of performance enhancements, bug fixes, and improvements.\n\nWith thanks to the following contributors: [@jellysquid3](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=jellysquid3),  [@IMS212](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=IMS212), [@PepperCode1](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=PepperCode1), [@comp500](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=comp500), [@MCRcortex](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=MCRcortex), [@Noryea](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=Noryea), [@embeddedt](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=embeddedt), [@Grayray75](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=Grayray75), and [@Moulberry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/commits?author=Moulberry).\n\nCompatible with **Minecraft 1.20.1 only** and **Fabric Loader 0.14 or newer**.\n\n**Note:** Many mods which interact with Sodium are likely to be incompatible with this update. You may have to wait for an update from the authors of those mods.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Dramatically improved the performance of terrain rendering in nearly every way.**\n  - Chunk loading is dramatically faster, uses much fewer resources (both CPU and RAM), and should feel much smoother than before.\n    - The amount of time needed to load new chunks (referred to as \"meshing\") has been greatly reduced, and is anywhere from 40% to 60% faster than the previous release.\n    - Memory allocation rate while loading the geometry for new chunks has been decreased by around 80%. \n  - Occlusion culling is anywhere from 25-45% faster now, and the long-standing bugs with it have also been fixed\n    - You've probably experienced those issues where certain parts of the world don't seem to render when looked at from certain angles. Well, those issues are fixed now!\n  - Terrain rendering now uses shared index buffers which can reduce video memory bandwidth/usage requirements by up to 25%.\n- **Fixed major performance regressions NVIDIA graphics cards.**  (anywhere from 200% to 300% faster than previous release...)\n    - If you were previously disappointed by the performance you were getting on a NVIDIA GPU, try this version.\n- \"Render Pass Consolidation\" has been added, which greatly reduces the number of render passes needed for the world (hugely improves CPU and GPU utilization.) This also helps to prevent excessive amounts of overdraw, and ensures larger batches of geometry are sent to the GPU for rendering.\n- \"Block Face Culling\" has been significantly improved, which allows for more blocks to be eligible for early geometry culling (hugely improves GPU utilization.) This generally makes the biggest difference in foliage-heavy scenes.\n- Many other performance enhancements which are too numerous to describe here.\n\n## Other notable changes\n\n- A lot of issues with biome color blending have been fixed. This means it is no longer incorrectly applied to certain blocks, especially those from other mods. Additionally, it's much faster to calculate the colors used by certain blocks, which helps improve world load times.\n- A lot of issues were also fixed with smooth lighting! This should fix some issues with certain resource packs, and the lighting with blocks like Sculk Sensors.\n- Mip-mapping has been greatly improved so that terrain no longer has a black outline around certain textures when viewed at extreme angles. (Note: This has the consequence that some textures, such as those used for leaves, may seem slightly brighter than they did before. However, we think this generally looks more accurate to the original texture work, and believe the original behavior was a bug.) \n- When supported, the mod will now request a \"No Error Context\", which allows the graphics driver to skip some unnecessary CPU overhead during rendering. This slightly helps improve performance on some graphics card drivers.\n- A new driver compatibility and workarounds system has been implemented, which helps to inform the user of possible performance issues & automatically fix them. \n- Line rendering (used by things like Structure Blocks and Hitbox Rendering) is no longer broken.\n- ... Many other improvements for mod compatibility.",

The default number of threads used for chunk building is more optimally chosen and should help improve frame rates on slower CPUs.\n- Improved the precision of the compressed vertex format, reducing texture glitches found with some texture packs and vanilla blocks\n- The inner faces of leaves are no longer rendered if fast graphics are enabled, significantly reducing the geometry count of scenes with lots of foliage (thanks ADudeCalledLeo.)\n- Config file handling has been greatly improved, and if a corrupted config file is found, the user will be prompted to fix the problem instead of the game crashing.\n\n### And everything else...\n- Mods which provide config file overrides will no longer crash on first startup (thanks tbejos.)\n- Improved our shader code slightly to reduce overhead in the vertex stage, potentially helping older graphics cards.\n- Improved compatibility with the legacy AMD graphics drivers on Windows.\n- Fixed a problem where empty draw calls would be submitted during chunk rendering.\n- Some other minor improvements and fixes...",

This can help with loading into worlds or when many blocks are changing at once.\n- Improved the amount of time it takes to rebuild the chunk graph. This can reduce lag associated with moving around in the world or loading chunks at higher render distances. \n- Many new optimizations for high resolution texture packs, especially when animated textures are used.\n- Fixes and improvements for fog effects during sunrise/sunset and while underwater, helping to improve visuals drastically.\n- Reduced VRAM usage in ocean biomes and other environments with lots of water. \n- Support for custom translations (to be added in a future release)\n- Improvements to particle rendering/culling, helping performance in particle heavy servers.\n- Additional optimizations for biome color blending.\n- ... and many other smaller, miscellaneous optimizations specific to Minecraft 1.17.",

Depending on the situation, significant performance improvements can be seen for both [block entity rendering](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791199652410032150/792627201463287818/unknown.png), [mob rendering](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791199652410032150/792627353401950208/unknown.png), and text rendering.\n- Improved hardware support for AMD and Intel GPUs on Windows, allowing the use of multi-draw rendering where it was otherwise broken in the past. Multi-draw chunk rendering can drastically improve frame rates where supported.\n- Switched to using the new ThinGL library, which allows Sodium code to use a stateless abstraction over OpenGL. This helps to improve performance, mod compatibility, stability, and future compatibility with Minecraft 1.17.\n- Preparing chunk updates for rendering now takes much less time by better taking advantage of multi-threading, greatly improving frame times while loading or updating chunks.\n- Many new optimizations for our chunk graph and culling algorithm, helping to reduce CPU load and improve frame rates while playing.\n- Improved compatibility with many mods depending on additional block data to be available during chunk building, such as LambdaBetterGrass.\n- Added an API other mods can use to disable Sodium features. Sometimes, incompatibilities can arise, but mods supporting this functionality can ask Sodium to disable specific parts of itself automatically to avoid these.\n- Fixed large memory leaks that could occur when unloading and loading many worlds repeatedly.\n- Fixed terrain stitching issues caused by high-resolution texture packs and exotic block models.   \n- Fixed some issues with smooth block and entity lighting, notably with emissive properties.\n- Fixed issues where the top-face of fluids would disappear at certain camera angle, or while inside a fluid.\n- Fixed many issues causing chunks not to update or appear when looking in certain directions.\n- Issues with render distance and fog effects when using certain mods have been fixed.\n... and much, much more.\n\nYou can find a number of issues that were fixed with this release [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/milestone/2?closed=1).
